ProjectWorkFlowView
-add action button to projects centerara workflow view similer to the one implemented in @intakeform editor.flow new entries and add button down
make default button with no entries nicer or just an icon

- proposed new action button exists in @projectlistview

-make sure project workflow view works with new project creation flow
