ProjectWorkFlowView
-add action button to projects centerara workflow view similer to the one implemented in @intakeform editor.flow new entries and add button down
make default button with no entries nicer or just an icon

-project dropdown needs refactor, new project button broken, other selections irrelevant, including template (as projects exist as records)
- proposed new action button exists in @projectlistview

-make sure project workflow view works with new project creation flow

exportcontextprovider for panels when aggregate is active or within an aggregate workflow

-connection to helper from frontend Ingjestion/Import interface fails.
