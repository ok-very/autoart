Templating (Large Feature)

    Create an output engine to compile fields. Will work like a highlighter view, where you are able to activate a special state and then go through the project views and flag every field that will be compiled. It will have an output module that will determine the output formatting (injection into a spreadsheet or document). These output modules can use the interface to map or upload js/py scripts.
